What I am envisioning:

- A dashboard with a grid of squares that display reactor information
- Basic info will be how full, how hot, maybe pressure?
- Each info square will also be a button that brings you to the info page for a specific vessel.

Vessel page

- Vessel page will have a full-screen view of the reactor with histograms at the bottom for key values
- Histograms will have buttons that set the time frame (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 8hr, 24hr etc)
